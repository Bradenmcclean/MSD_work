Hello World this is a really long filme so I can see if my pipes work correctly which they probaly will not. Implement background commands. If a command runs in the background, the shell should not wait for it to complete before letting the user enter another command. After the user types a new command and presses enter, the shell should check to see if any backgrounded commands have completed and an informative message saying so. The user indicates that a command should be bTest in small pieces (always)!
There's lots of tricky bits to futz with that your classmates have probably dealt with, or will have to deal with, so talk to each other + TA!
man pages are a good resource (if boring and sometimes hard to read).
EVERY SYSTEM CALL RETURN VALUE SHOULD BE CHECKED! For this assignment, if something goes wrong: log it with perror() and clean up (close open file descriptors, etc).
Have fun! You're doing something really cool here, apeter to execvp expects the last pointer in the list to be null.
I was unable to call exec without using const_cast. This works like static_cast, but it adds/removes const. This is generally a bad thing to do, however, since exec will overwrite the whole program memory, we really don't care about the const-ness of our argv array.
argv[0] should be the name of the program being run
The provided code should be helpful for doing some of the necessary text processing, and should fill in the command struct correctly without any I/O redirection
